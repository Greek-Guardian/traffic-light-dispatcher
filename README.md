# traffic-light-dispatcher
This project is to solve the problem of traffic light dispatching.
In our daily life, we often see cases that cars get stoppen because the traffic light turns red, even if there is no traffic in the other direction of the cross, which makes the traffic less efficient than it could have been. Also, when cars in one direction are far more than the other, the traffic lights refuse to make changes on timing to adjust this situation
